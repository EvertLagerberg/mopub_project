About

This web app was made as a project in the course Mobile development with web technologies (DM2518) Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan,KTH


The idea of the site is to use the KTH Social schedule service to easily find the location for every event and quickly get a quick overview of all the events for a day of lectures, seminars and labs at KTH Campus.

After exporting your KTH Schedule into this web page, you will be able to see all the events of your schoolday. You can see the exact location for each event, and load a route on how to get there from your current location.

Today the service is limited to KTH , but it could easily expand to other organizations as well
